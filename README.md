# Word vs. World


This repository contains code for extracting co-occurrence statistics from Wikipedia articles.
These co-occurrences will later be utilized as experimental stimuli to understand how regularities in language interact with our knowledge about regularities in the world.

## Branches

* master branch : count co-occurrences in windows
* no-window: count co-occurrences in noun chunks

## Order of Operations

1. Generate vocab based on desired size and constraints.
2. Update params.py with vocab_name to be utilized.
3. Submit job to Ludwig.
4. Retrieve results and save to database.
5. Query database to find desired word pairs.

## Background

The input text files are stored on the [UIUC Learning & Language Lab](http://learninglanguagelab.org/) file server.
The Python package `Ludwig` is used to interact with files on the server.
More information about `Ludwig` can be found [here](https://github.com/phueb/Ludwig).

### The corpus as an abstraction

To `Ludwig`, a corpus is an abstraction.
That is, there is no single text file to uniquely identify a Wikipedia corpus.
Instead, a corpus is made up of multiple text files that exist in `research_data/CreateWikiCorpus/runs`.
Moreover, there are multiple corpora saved on the server.
But, each text file is only associated with a single corpus. 

### Retrieving text files
 
So, how are all text files associated with a single corpus retrieved?
This is where a parameter configuration comes in. 
Each text file is co-located with a `param2val.yaml` file, which represents its parameter configuration.
A parameter configuration is simply the set of parameters used to create a single corpus.
Thus, in order to retrieve a single corpus, all text files associated with the same parameter configuration must be retrieved.

The safest method for obtaining only those text files that make up a specific corpus of interest, is to manually inspect the folders in `research_data/CreateWikiCorpus/runs`. Inspect each `param2val.yaml` file, and if the parameter configuration matches, note the parameter configuration id, a.ka. `param_name`. This unique ID can be used to programmatically retrieve a specifc set of text files that make up a specific corpus of interest.


## Usage

Access to the UIUC file server is required. If the remote directory `research_data` is mounted at `/media/research_data` as is the default in Linux, you can:

```bash
ludwig 
```
If, `research_data` is not mounted at `media/research_data` (e.g. on MacOs, the default mounting point is `/Volumes/`, the mounting point needs to be specified:

```bash
ludwig -mnt /Volumes/research_data 
```

To run jobs locally, rather than on `Ludwig` workers:

```bash
ludwig --local
```

Notice, however, that access to the server is still required for fetching corpus data.

Running locally is especially useful for debugging. 
To run a single minimal configuration, using a small number of articles and a reduced vocabulary:

```bash
ludwig --local --minimal
```
